# Amazon.com-Clone
Replication of Amazon.com Website using HTML, CSS, and Sass â€“ Desktop Viewing Recommended on Desktop Screen Only

Welcome to my project showcasing the replication of the Amazon.com website using the trio of web development tools: ``HTML, CSS, and Sass.``

In this project, I've endeavored to recreate the familiar interface of Amazon.com, paying attention to design details, layout, and overall visual appeal. The use of HTML provided the structural foundation, while CSS was employed for styling elements to match the aesthetics of the original site. To maintain a clean and organized codebase, I utilized Sass, a powerful CSS preprocessor.

I invite you to explore the project on your desktop or laptop browser to get the most out of the experience. Please note that at present, the project may not be optimized for responsiveness across various devices. This means that while the replication may shine on larger screens, it might not provide the same experience on mobile devices.

##Key Points:
```
Replicated Amazon.com using HTML, CSS, and Sass.
Focused on capturing the essence of the original design.
Optimized for desktop and laptop viewing.
```
As the project evolves, I am actively working on enhancing its responsiveness and compatibility with smaller screens. Your feedback and insights will be invaluable in guiding these improvements.
